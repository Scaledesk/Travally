Ajax Search Plugin lets your online customers search for their required products on your site.

== Description ==

More often than not, your online customers are acting with great haste on your site. They neither have patience nor interest in going through your category dropdowns click-by-click for finding their desired items. Infact, if your customers specifically know what they want, they would rather search it in a search box. 

Ajax Search Woocommerce Plugin lets your customers do exactly that- it lets them search what they are specifically looking for. Not only that, the plugin also enhances your customers search experience by providing them with autosuggestions.

1. Option to add a search box in any Widget Area simply  by dragging and dropping the Widget.Widget is already created.
2. Option to write your own Search Button text.
3. Option to set minimum number of characters required to trigger autosuggest.
4. Option to set maximum number of results shown in autosuggest box.
